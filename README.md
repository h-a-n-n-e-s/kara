This package has a very __specific personalized functionality__, it runs a __shell script__ which tries to compile your currently active file in its directory and writes the (copyable) stdout/stderr into a new pane with some style.

__Attention:__ This package is probably __not useful for you, except you are new to Atom and want to write a package__ which does something close to what is described above. In this case feel free to __have a look at the code__. Reasons why the code may be helpful:

  - It is __reduced to the necessary__, essentially one file lib/kara.coffee plus a style file (all _Povray_ stuff can be ignored and the shell script lib/run is of no interest for the Atom functionality).
  
  - There are no specs, menus, subscriptions, disposables, promises (definitely no promises), etc... stuff which can __confuse beginners__.

  - There is some __in-line documentation__.
